# New-Project-Deforestation-Project

This project is for an organization who is on a mission to reduce deforestation around the world to raise its awareness about this important environmental topic and looking to understand which countries and regions around the world seem to have forests that have been shrinking in size, and also which countries and regions have the most significant forest area, both in terms of amount and percent of total area.

The hope is that these findings can help inform initiatives, communications, and personnel allocation to achieve the largest impact with the precious few resources that the organization has at its disposal.

3 Tables of data will be put together that I'd like to query to answer some of the most important questions to help understand the global deforestation.

The Files

Files of data have been provided dealing with forestation as well as total land area and region grouping:

- Forest_area csv fie
- Land_area csv file
- Regions csv file
